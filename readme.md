<p>Salutations, my official name is Ricky Chan. But I prefer you call me Red or Ricky, it just sounds better. I have been an independent web developer for years, along with the role of freelancer. I created GoDotWebs by myself and have also been running it by myself. I know, you will see a lot of "we" on the official website. But trust me, it's all myself, it just sounds more professional. I call myself "The Forgotten One" because perhaps nobody understands what I am doing or actually knows what I am doing, only a few of them I guess. I've created GoDotWebs, got some clients, earned a tiny bitty of profit, and am currently hoping to carve a better path because I am actually so young that you probably can't imagine how old I am by the time I was writing this thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, consider <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/thered">buying me a coffee</a> because I sorta need it to feed energy to myself. Thank you.</p>
